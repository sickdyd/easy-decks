## Easy Decks

This project aims at helping students memorize "cards" containing a question or information on one side and the answer on another. The application will show less and less frequently cards that are being answered correctly.

## Motivation

I wanted to build a card system study for Japanese kanji. After briefly exploring the options available I decided to build my custom solution.
